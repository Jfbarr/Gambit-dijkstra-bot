# Gambit-dijkstra-bot
This repository contains the source code for my submission to the CoderOne AI challenge in December 2020.

Our bot uses a method that has been applied to direct AI in other games such as Brogue, known as Dijkstra maps within the gaming space. These models have also been referred to as _potential_ or _flow_ methods in more scientific domains. For a write-up demonstrating the theory and the usefulness of these methods, see [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps). Our code makes use of a Python implemention written by [Kehvarl](https://github.com/Kehvarl/Dijkstra).
